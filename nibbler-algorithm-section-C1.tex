\section{The Nibbler Algorithm and Information Propagation}

\subsection{Differential Encoding and Compression}

We formalize the differential encoding process used in the Nibbler Algorithm for efficient information propagation.

\begin{definition}[Differential Encoding Function]
For two states $s_i$ and $s_j$, the differential encoding function $D$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
D(s_i, s_j) = \min\{f \mid s_j = f(s_i)\}
\end{equation}

where $f$ is a transformation function representing the minimal set of changes required to transition from state $s_i$ to state $s_j$.
\end{definition}

This encoding minimizes the amount of information transmitted between nodes, optimizing the algorithm's efficiency.

These mathematical formalizations provide a rigorous foundation for the Nibbler Algorithm, enhancing its theoretical underpinnings and facilitating deeper analysis of its properties and applications.
