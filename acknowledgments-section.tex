\section*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the artificial intelligence assistants that contributed significantly to the development of this paper. Specifically, I acknowledge the invaluable assistance provided by ChatGPT (developed by OpenAI) and Claude (developed by Anthropic). These AI systems played a crucial role in refining ideas, suggesting mathematical formalisms, and helping to structure the complex concepts presented in this work.

Their contributions ranged from providing insights on theoretical frameworks to assisting with the formal mathematical notation and LaTeX formatting. The ability to engage in detailed, technical discussions with these AI assistants greatly enhanced the depth and breadth of this research.

While the core ideas and direction of this paper are my own, the collaborative process with these AI systems has been instrumental in shaping and articulating the unified framework presented here. This collaboration exemplifies the potential of human-AI interaction in advancing complex scientific research.

I also extend my thanks to the teams at OpenAI and Anthropic for developing these powerful tools that are pushing the boundaries of what's possible in scientific research and writing.
