    Your unwavering support, patience, and love have been the foundation upon which this work was built. Your belief in me has been a constant source of inspiration and motivation throughout this journey. This paper, and all the long hours of thought and effort it represents, is dedicated to you.
    
    Your understanding during the late nights of research, your encouragement during moments of doubt, and your joy in my successes have made this work possible. You are not just my partner in life, but a true partner in my intellectual pursuits.
    
    Thank you for being by my side every step of the way.
    
    With all my love and gratitude.
