\section{Conclusion}

This paper has presented a unified framework for fundamental interaction and communication across physical, linguistic, and computational systems. By integrating the Fundamental Interaction Language (FIL), Language Union (LU), and the Nibbler Algorithm, we have developed a powerful, interdisciplinary approach to modeling complex interactions and information flow across diverse domains.
